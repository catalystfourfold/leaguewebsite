    <h2>Bob Spence's Obituary</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="solo-bubble nunito" id="info">
    <p>Peacefully, after a hard-fought battle with cancer, God called Bob home to play in the "Ultimate Major Leagues", at the age of 74. Loving husband and best friend of Karen (Shaw) for 48 years. Much loved Dad to Shannon and her husband Brad Archibald. Cherished and proud Papa to Zach and Luke. Very dear uncle to Dave and Sherry Robins and their children Joey and Justin. Will be greatly missed by brother-in-law George Robins and best friends Wayne and Lorraine Powell, as well as family in Nova Scotia and England, and many friends in Hamilton and throughout Southern Ontario. Predeceased by his beloved sister Bonnie Robins, and parents Erwin and Evelyn Spence. Bob loved golfing and playing baseball with the Hamilton Oldtimers Baseball Organization, cheering on his Ti Cats, Leafs, Raptors, and Blue Jays, but most of all, being with friends and family. Bob and Karen were blessed to attend The South Gate Presbyterian Church and appreciated all the support from their friends there. Special thanks to our amazing Oncologist Dr. Hotte. For over 40 years, Bob enjoyed a rewarding career in journalism, with the majority of time spent with Thomson Newspapers and the Information and Privacy Commission of Ontario. Flowers gratefully declined. If desired, donations to the Canadian Cancer Society would be greatly appreciated. We would like to thank all of our friends and family who were with us throughout Bob's cancer journey. Your love, support and your continual prayers will never be forgotten. Most of all, we thank God, who walked this road with us, and has now carried Bob to victory.</p>
